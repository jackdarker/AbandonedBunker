You've made a huge discovery and accomplishment - you've successfully created a human being with the genetic platform necessary to create and test serious genetic changes and accelerated growth formulas.</br>
What is your name?</br><<textbox "$m_PlayerName" "Player">>

The problem is that - despite your visionary and daring genius - you haven't developed any applications for the platform, and you can't apply these new products.</br>
To do this, you've had to cheat in one regard - you had to play God and create a human being with this genetic platform.</br> 

What's her name?</br><<textbox "$m_PartnerName" "Jenny">>
She is a violation of several international conventions and will probably get you banned everywhere, but you did it. A female with the genetic alterations necessary to test your methods and products. She's accelerated in age to adulthood and has been educated as best as your science and technology can provide. </br>
Of course, nothing is perfect. She's not very smart, but you treat her well and she gets along with you. You've actually grown quite fond of her. She's agreed to the experiments after you've explained what it is you want to accomplish and that the goal is to make her and others better or stronger.</br>
As well, you could experiment on yourself, but you'll need to trust your new partner to do what's right for you, and do it correctly.</br>
Swallowing the ethical problems you are nearly drowning with, the fateful day has come where you begin your experiments. You have a pile of scrap and material, but now you just need to make the discoveries you need to conduct experiments at your home and Lab FAR, FAR away from everyone else - where no one will catch you.
You have retreated to this remote island to become the Mad Scientist you decided to be. It's not much but a small studio and a lab, but you're slowly pulling it all together. With your new Partner, it should be a little easier. </br>

!How to SCIENCE!!!
Okay, <<print $m_PlayerName>>, every day, you get 3 actions.</br>
Gathering, refining, and using a machine are all an Action.</br>
Doing an activity with <<print $m_PartnerName>> is also an action.</br>
Anything else is assumed a Free Action, since they are usually a trivial in their amount of time needed.</br>
Pursuing Science on this island will require you be prepared and resourceful. You'll need to both collect, build, and maintain your lab and base. You will need Resources and Research.</br>
Ideally, you want to earn Research Points by transforming <<print $m_PartnerName>> and yourself. You may also gain points in other ways, but the best way is transforming.</br>
Transforming yourself requires <<print $m_PartnerName>>'s help to work the machine and collect data in your stead.</br>
<<print $m_PartnerName>> trusts you to conduct experiments that help her. Some things you choose to do may lower her trust of you. That would be bad. Some experiments may change her personality or be displeasing to her, which may also change her personality.</br>
This is all important, because for every action you do, <<print $m_PartnerName>> gets to do an action, too! </br>
Your ultimate goals are up to you - pursue whatever end you wish, but be careful, since you need <<print $m_PartnerName>>'s help.</br>
Be careful, though. There are several endings, and some of them are bad endings.</br>

:: The Lab
<section><aside id="sidebar"></aside><article><%=window.story.render("CenterDialogs")%>
Your lab is a hidden building in an isolated place next to a tremendous abandoned junkyard. You've managed to clean it up and are hidden far from the prying eyes and meddling hands of civilization.

You decide to go out and collect anything that seems useful. You exit the lab and spend some time walking around the Junkyard and around the island.</br>
